# Boston's Rainfall Patterns Analysis (2010-2018)

## Overview

This project presents an in-depth analysis of the rainfall patterns in Boston, Massachusetts, from 2010 to 2018. Using data visualization techniques, specifically D3.js, we explore the yearly and monthly rainfall trends to understand the city's climate dynamics, drought periods, and heavy rainfall events.

## Data Source

The rainfall data was collected from [BWSC Website](https://www.bwsc.org/environment-education/rainfall-garden), a comprehensive database providing historical weather observations across the United States. The dataset includes monthly rainfall measurements in inches from several locations within Boston.

## Methodology

The analysis involved the following steps:
- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the raw data to remove any inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
- Data Aggregation: Summarizing the data by year and by month to identify trends over time.
- Visualization: Creating interactive charts using D3.js to display yearly trends, monthly patterns, and location-based rainfall comparisons.

## Key Findings

1. **Yearly Trends**: The analysis revealed a significant year of high rainfall in 2011, followed by a period of decreasing rainfall, indicating a drought phase that lasted until 2014.
2. **Monthly Patterns**: The months of June and July typically received the highest rainfall, while February and May were the driest.
3. **Location Comparison**: Rainfall varied significantly across different locations in Boston, with Mattapan consistently receiving more rainfall than Hyde Park.

## Interactive Visualizations

The project features several interactive charts that allow users to explore Boston's rainfall patterns in detail:
- A bar chart showing the total annual rainfall of 2010.
- Line charts depicting monthly rainfall trends for selected years.
- A stacked area chart comparing rainfall across different locations.

## Conclusion

The analysis of Boston's rainfall patterns from 2010 to 2018 highlights the city's variable climate, with years of ample rainfall followed by periods of drought. Understanding these patterns is crucial for water resource management and urban planning in Boston.
